# Setting Up the Build Environment
It is recommended to use VSCode for compiling this project under Windows. Below are detailed steps for configuring the development environment and compiling the project files.


1. Configure the Windows Development Environment

This SDK project is designed specifically for Windows systems, with Code::Blocks as the default development environment. The configuration process mainly consists of the following three steps:

1. **Download and install the Windows version of Code::Blocks**: You can get it from [Code::Blocks Windows Version](https://pkgman.jieliapp.com/s/codeblocks) and install it.
2. **Open and close Code::Blocks for the first time**: After installation, open Code::Blocks for the first time and then close it immediately. This operation is to generate the necessary configuration files for subsequent development work.
3. **Download and install the latest version of the JieLi Windows toolchain**: Get the latest version from [Latest JieLi Windows Toolchain](https://pkgman.jieliapp.com/s/win-toolchain) and install it.

After completing the above steps, you can open the Code::Blocks project and start compiling and developing. (It is recommended to use VSCode for compiling and development.)

If you need more toolchains and post-processing tools, please refer to: **[Latest Tool Versions](https://doc.zh-jieli.com/Tools/zh-cn/other_info/index.html)**.

2. Compile the SDK Using VSCode

Compiling the SDK with VSCode is done by invoking the make command. The specific steps are as follows:
1. Open the project in the SDK root directory using VSCode, as shown below:

<img src={firmware_open_vscode} alt="firmware" width="400" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />


2. Install the necessary extensions: **Task Explorer** and **C/C++**. See the images below:

<img src={firmware_vscode_task} alt="firmware" width="400" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />

<img src={firmware_vscode_c_cpp_ext} alt="firmware" width="400" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />

3. Select the corresponding task to compile: Click **TASK EXPLORER > SDK > vscode** to view the available task list, which includes:
    - **all**: to build the entire project
    - **clean**: to clean the build output files
    See the image below:

<img src={firmware_vscode_build} alt="firmware" width="400" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />

3. Run Build Tasks in the Project Root Directory

1.  **Get the code:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Buddie-AI/Buddie.git
    cd Buddie/Firmware-JL701N
    ```

2. Click **TASK EXPLORER > SDK > vscode > all** to start compiling.
3. After a successful build, you will see `生成UFW文件 jl_isd.ufw` ("UFW file jl_isd.ufw generated") as shown below:

<img src={build_ok} alt="firmware" width="400" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />
