Since the official only provides Chinese version development documentation, developers unfamiliar with Chinese may face some challenges.



To help developers quickly find the content they need, I will briefly introduce the above materials.

## 1 JL7016G Datasheet

File location: `./Firmware-JL701N/doc/datasheet/JL7016G Datasheet V1.3.pdf`
JL7016G Datasheet V1.3 mainly introduces the detailed specifications of the JL JL7016G chip, which is a technical manual for hardware engineers or embedded developers


## 2 JL7016G TWS Earphone Standard Schematic 

File location: `./Firmware-JL701N/doc/datasheet/JL7016G Datasheet V1.3.pdf`
This schematic document provides complete hardware design reference for developing high-integration TWS Bluetooth earphone products (with ANC + ENC + spatial audio) using the JL7016G chip, including interface connections, filtering/protection, power layout, soldering recommendations, etc., ensuring the product meets requirements in terms of functionality, reliability, and manufacturability.

## 3 API Reference

File location: `./Firmware-JL701N/doc/html/`
This is a very detailed API documentation. For users who want to perform secondary development based on Buddie, this document will be very helpful.
This document includes but is not limited to the following aspects:
1. SDK technical framework
2. Operating system APIs
3. File system APIs
4. Peripheral driver APIs
5. Bluetooth protocol stack development description

It should be noted that the document version and the current SDK version are not completely matched, and the following issues may exist:
1. Function interfaces exist in the SDK that cannot be found in the documentation
2. Some APIs in the documentation are not supported in the SDK
